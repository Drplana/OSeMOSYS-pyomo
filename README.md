### Quick start

If you want to download the latest version from github for use or development purposes, make sure that you have git and an [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/) installed and type the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drplana/OSeMOSYS-pyomo.git
cd OSeMOSYS-pyomo
conda env create  # Automatically creates environment based on environment.yml
conda activate osemosys # Activate the environment
```

The above commands create a dedicated environment so that your conda configuration remains clean from the required dependencies installed.

To check that everything runs fine, you can run the python files provided in the scripts folder.
